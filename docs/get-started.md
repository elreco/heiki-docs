#### Step 1: Install Node.js

* Before you can launch a JavaScript application using Node.js, you must first have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download the installer for your operating system from the official Node.js website ([https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)).

#### Step 2: Unzip Heiki

* When you download the Heiki archive, you can find two folders:
  * \`heiki\`
  * \`documentation\`
* Get the \`heiki\` content folder and unzip this on your computer.

#### Step 3: Install dependencies

* Open a command line interface
* Go to the project root folder, previously unzipped in the step 2
* Run the following command: `npm i`

#### Step 4: Run the project

* Now run this command: `npm run start`
* Go to http://localhost:3000
* Congrats! You have run the project successfully! :tada:
