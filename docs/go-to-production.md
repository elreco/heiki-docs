We recommend to use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to host your website.\

Hosting a website on Vercel is a simple and straightforward process. Here is a step-by-step tutorial on how to do it:

1. First, create an account on Vercel by signing up with your email address and password.
2. Next, create a new project by clicking on the "New Project" button on the dashboard.
3. Once your project is created, you will be taken to the project settings page. From here, you can customize your project's settings and configure your domain.
4. To deploy your website, you can either use the built-in Git integration or manually upload your files. If you're using Git, connect your repository and configure the branch to deploy. If you're uploading files manually, simply drag and drop your files onto the upload box.
5. Once the files are uploaded and the build process is complete, your website will be live and accessible at the URL provided in the project settings page.
6. If you want to use your own domain, you can add it to your project settings and configure your DNS records to point to Vercel's servers.

That's it! Your website is now live and hosted on Vercel. You can make updates and changes to your website and deploy them with just a few clicks.
